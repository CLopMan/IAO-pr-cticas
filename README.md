## Practica 1
Developed a total of 32 RNA models using Altair AI Studio, following two approaches for processing Spanish reservoir data:
- Process the data as a non-time-related series.
- Process the data as a time-related series.

The best models from each approach were used to predict the water level for the next 3 weeks of a reservoir.
